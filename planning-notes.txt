        <!-- <Navbar.../> - "Home" and "New Chirp" links -->
        <Timeline.../> - component with running list of Chirps, newest at top (<ul><li><Chirp.../></li></ul>) structure?
            GET the list of chirps
            GET the current user ('your timeline') so they can CLICK the like/reply buttons in each chirp

            <Chirp.../> - component containing Chirp information. When clicked will take user to <ViewChirp> (route: '/chirp/:id')
                GET the information for a each chirp to display to user

                SAVE the like/reply information (which user liked it)

                data:

                timestamp - when the chirp was entered

Which data should live in the store?

    submitted chirp information
    user information

Which componenets should access store via "connect()"? (these would be considered "containers" I think)
    <App/>
    <Home/>
    <Chirp/>
    <ViewChirp/>

    <LikeButton/> - provisional, may not need store access, since it's probably a presentation-only component, can get info from props.
            Note: when user hits the button, that user's id will be added to chirp's "likes" array. if user hits it again, will have to remove
            the user. This may be a user funtion, we can pass it as a prop.

Possible state/store objects:
{
    chirps: {
        chirpId,
        authorId,
        timestamp,
        replies,//array of chirp ids that replied to this chirp
        replyingTo,// id of chirp this is a reply to. Can be empty/null
        likes //array of user ids who liked this chirp
    }

    authors: {
        authorId,
        authorName,
        authorAvatar,
        authorEmail,
        chirpsArray, //array of chirp IDs this author has created
    }

    currentUser: {// called "authedUser" in course docs.
        authorId
    }
}
